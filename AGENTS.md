# mica-mqtt-docs Agent Instructions

Welcome, agent! You are operating in the `mica-mqtt-docs` repository, which contains the official documentation for the `mica-mqtt` project. This guide provides essential information to help you navigate, understand, and modify the codebase effectively.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Documentation site for the `mica-mqtt` framework.
- **Tech Stack**: VuePress v2 (Vite bundler), Vue 3, TypeScript, and `vuepress-theme-hope`.
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (indicated by `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- **Core Directories**:
  - `src/`: Contains the Markdown source files and VuePress configuration (`.vuepress/`).
  - `.github/`: CI/CD and GitHub Actions workflows.

## 2. Available Commands

Since this is a documentation site built with VuePress, standard testing frameworks (like Jest or Vitest) are not currently configured. Workflows are primarily focused on previewing and building the documentation.

Use `pnpm` to execute all scripts:

- **Start Development Server** (Local Preview):
  ```bash
  pnpm run docs:dev
  ```
  *Use this to preview changes locally. It enables hot-module replacement (HMR).*

- **Clean Development Server Cache**:
  ```bash
  pnpm run docs:clean-dev
  ```
  *Use this if the dev server acts up or if caching issues occur.*

- **Build for Production**:
  ```bash
  pnpm run docs:build
  ```
  *Use this to verify that the documentation builds correctly before submitting a PR. **Always ensure the site builds without errors!***

- **Update Dependencies** (VuePress ecosystem):
  ```bash
  pnpm run docs:update-package
  ```

### Running Tests

*Note: There are no unit or integration tests (e.g., `npm run test`) currently defined in the `package.json`. Your primary "test" is ensuring `pnpm run docs:build` completes without compilation errors and that Markdown renders correctly in the `docs:dev` server.*

## 3. Code Style and Guidelines

When contributing to this repository, please adhere to the following standards:

### 3.1. Markdown Documentation

- **Frontmatter**: Ensure standard YAML frontmatter is used at the top of `.md` files (e.g., `title`, `author`, `order`) compatible with `vuepress-theme-hope`.
- **Links**: Use relative paths for internal links between Markdown files to ensure they work both locally and when deployed.
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ````java`, ````bash`, ````yaml`).
- **Formatting**: Keep Markdown clean and readable. Use standard heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- **Images/Assets**: Place static assets in `src/.vuepress/public/` and reference them using absolute paths starting with `/` (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).

### 3.2. TypeScript & Vue Configuration (`src/.vuepress/`)

- **Strict Typing**: The project includes a `tsconfig.json`. Ensure any TypeScript configurations (like `config.ts`, `theme.ts`, `navbar.ts`, `sidebar.ts`) use appropriate types exported by `vuepress` or `vuepress-theme-hope`.
- **Imports**: 
  - Prefer modern ES modules syntax (`import`/`export`).
  - Avoid using Node.js specific globals without types.
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for types and interfaces.
  - Configuration files are typically named in kebab-case or camelCase depending on VuePress conventions (e.g., `theme.ts`, `client.ts`).
- **Formatting**: Adhere to the formatting defined by any `.editorconfig` or Prettier config if present. Otherwise, follow standard Vue/TS formatting conventions (2-space indent, quotes consistent with existing files).

### 3.3. Error Handling

- When writing custom Vue components or VuePress plugins, ensure that console errors are handled gracefully.
- Do not let undefined variables break the build process (`docs:build`).

## 4. Agent Operational Instructions

- **No Destructive Operations**: Do not delete source files unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **Language**: The project is heavily tailored for a Chinese-speaking audience (implied by "mica mqtt 文档" in `package.json`). Be mindful of localization; if you add new documentation, confirm the required language with the user (default to Chinese unless specified otherwise).
- **Proactiveness**: If a user asks to document a new feature, proactively ask if they need it added to the sidebar or navbar configurations (`src/.vuepress/sidebar.ts` or `navbar.ts`).
- **Build Verification**: After making substantial changes, always run `pnpm run docs:build` in the terminal to verify that the VuePress bundler can compile the site successfully.
